I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been runnin' with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been runnin' through the jungle
I've been cryin' with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

[Drop]
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, to get to you
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, to get to you
